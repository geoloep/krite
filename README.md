# krite
Krite is a collection of tools for creating web-based map applications. It mostly consists of wrappers around [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) and [Ractive.js](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive). Leaflet is used for creating the map component and Ractive.js for rendering the dom of the various side-components. The goal of krite is to create a consistent and pluggable api for interfacing between different kinds of data sources.

As of now documentation and tests are still lacking.
